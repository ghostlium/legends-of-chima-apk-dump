How to configure the build for localisation

===========================================

When the game is played locally it uses default configuration and localisation data embedded in the build.

The config.xml and localisation.xml are provided for hosting and are not used by a local build.

===========================================

To point the game to an external config file you can either host the config file or distribute with a pre-set config file. 

To Host:
Add the config file to use to a public FTP site.
Enter its URL into the index.html on line 45, an example line would be:
unityObject.embedUnity("unityPlayer", "WebPlayer.unity3d?config=http://demos.4t2.co.uk/legohfb/TTGLOC/config_EN_UK.xml", 640, 480, params);

To Supply A Preset Config:
Make sure that the config file is supplied in the same directory as the main game executable file (WebPlayer.unity3d)
add the name of the config file to line 45 of the index.html file. An example line would be:
unityObject.embedUnity("unityPlayer", "WebPlayer.unity3d?config=config_EN_UK.xml", 640, 480, params);

===========================================

The config.xml contains four nodes of relevance:

-------------------------------------------

1. <node name="webLanguage" value="EN_UK"/> is used to set the language by code (as defined in localisation.xml)

-------------------------------------------

2. <node name="localisationWeb" value="localisation"/> is used to point the game to a localisation URL.

To point the game to a localisation URL, host the localisation.xml and point the above node to its URL.

The localisation.xml contains ALL languages. To add a language, simply add a line into each node for the translation.

Also, when adding languages, please add the language to the node at the top of the localisation.xml file, 
which currently looks like this:

<list value="CS|DE|EN_DK|EN_NL|EN_UK|ES|ES_LA|FI|FR|FR_CA|IT|JP|KO|NO|PL|ZHSI" />

-------------------------------------------

3. <node name="playerCharacter" value="0100001"/> is used to define the player's starting character.

introduced for the partner version of the game, but work fine with the main release as well. 

Codes are used to not make it immediately obvious to Partner sites which character they have been set 
(and so how to manually change it themselves)

The possible codes to use are as follows:
0100001, LION_FOOTSOLDIOR - default in the full game. 
0100010, LION_LONGTOOTH
0100100, LION_LENNOX
0101000, LION_LAGRAVIS
0200001, CROC_CROOLER
0200010, CROC_CRUG
0200100, CROC_CROMINUS
0300001, EAGLE_ERIS
0400001, WOLF_WORRIS

These codes will change in the future as a few of these characters are going to be competitors in future level releases and the player cant be the same as the competitors. 

-------------------------------------------

4. <node name="showLegoAddress" value="1"/> is used to define if the lego.com site address (or localised equivalent) is shown in the game. 

The partner versions only have two levels to play and the others have "Play more at Lego.com" shown over them. 

Some partners prefer not to show or endorse other sites from thier own, if this is the case then change the value to "0"

and the text will not be shown. 

*** this line has no effect on Main release builds ***
